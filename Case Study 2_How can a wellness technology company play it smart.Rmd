## Introduction and background

#### This is meant to be a sample starter script if you choose to use R
#### for this case study. This is not comprehensive of everything you'll
#### do in the case study, but should be used as a starting point if it is helpful for you.


## Upload your CSV files to R
#### Remember to upload your CSV files to your project from the relevant data source:
#### https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit
#### Remember, there are many different CSV files in the dataset.
#### We have uploaded two CSVs into the project, but you will likely
#### want to use more than just these two CSV files.

## Installing and loading common packages and libraries
```{r}
# You can always install and load packages along the way as you may
# discover you need different packages after you start your analysis.
# If you already have some of these packages installed and loaded, you
# can skip those ones - or you can choose to run those specific lines of
#code anyway. It may take a few moments to run.
#Install and load the tidyverse

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```
## Load your CSV files
```{r}
# Create a dataframe named 'daily_activity' and read in one
# of the CSV files from the dataset. Remember, you can name your dataframe
# something different, and you can also save your CSV file under a different name as well.
daily_activity <- dailyActivity_merged

# Create another dataframe for the sleep data.
sleep_day <- sleepDay_merged
```
## Explore a few key tables ##

```{r}
# Take a look at the daily_activity data.
head(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
# Identify all the columns in the daily_activity data.
colnames(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
# Take a look at the sleep_day data.
head(sleep_day)
```
```{r}
# Identify all the columns in the daily_activity data.
colnames(sleep_day)

# Note that both datasets have the 'Id' field -
# this can be used to merge the datasets.
```
## Understanding some summary statistics
```{r}
# How many unique participants are there in each dataframe?
# It looks like there may be more participants in the daily activity
# dataset than the sleep dataset.
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$Id)
```
```{r}
# How many observations are there in each dataframe?
nrow(daily_activity)

nrow(sleep_day)
```
```{r}
# What are some quick summary statistics we'd want to know about each data frame?
# For the daily activity dataframe:
daily_activity %>%
select(TotalSteps,
TotalDistance,
SedentaryMinutes) %>%
summary()
```
```{r}
# For the sleep dataframe:
sleep_day %>%
select(TotalSleepRecords,
TotalMinutesAsleep,
TotalTimeInBed) %>%
summary()

# What does this tell us about how this sample of people's activities?
```
## Plotting a few explorations

```{r}
# What's the relationship between steps taken in a day and sedentary minutes?
# How could this help inform the customer segments that we can market to?
# E.g. position this more as a way to get started in walking more?
# Or to measure steps that you're already taking?
ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
# What's the relationship between minutes asleep and time in bed?
# You might expect it to be almost completely linear - are there any unexpected trends?

ggplot(data=sleep_day, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + geom_point()

# What could these trends tell you about how to help market this product? Or areas where you might want to explore further?
```
## Merging these two datasets together
```{r}
combined_data <- merge(sleep_day, daily_activity, by="Id")
```
```{r}
# Take a look at how many participants are in this data set.

n_distinct(combined_data$Id)

# Note that there were more participant Ids in the daily activity
# dataset that have been filtered out using merge. Consider using 'outer_join'
# to keep those in the dataset.
# Now you can explore some different relationships between activity and sleep as well.
# For example, do you think participants who sleep more also take more steps or fewer
# steps per day? Is there a relationship at all? How could these answers help inform
# the marketing strategy of how you position this new product?
# This is just one example of how to get started with this data - there are many other
# files and questions to explore as well!
```
